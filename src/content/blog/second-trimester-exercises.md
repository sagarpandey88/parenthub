## Why the Second Trimester is Perfect for Exercise

The second trimester (weeks 13-26) is often called the "golden period" of pregnancy, and for good reason. Morning sickness typically subsides, energy levels rebound, and your belly isn't yet large enough to significantly impact movement. This makes it the ideal time to establish or maintain a consistent exercise routine that will benefit both you and your baby.

## Benefits of Second Trimester Exercise

### For Mom
- **Increased energy and mood improvement**
- **Better sleep quality**
- **Reduced back pain and pregnancy discomfort**
- **Improved circulation and reduced swelling**
- **Better weight management**
- **Preparation for labor and delivery**
- **Faster postpartum recovery**

### For Baby
- **Improved cardiovascular health**
- **Better birth weight outcomes**
- **Enhanced brain development**
- **Reduced risk of pregnancy complications**

## Exercise Guidelines for the Second Trimester

### General Safety Rules
1. **Get medical clearance** from your healthcare provider before starting any exercise program
2. **Listen to your body** and modify or stop if you feel uncomfortable
3. **Stay hydrated** before, during, and after exercise
4. **Avoid overheating** - exercise in cool environments and wear breathable clothing
5. **Maintain proper form** to prevent injury as your center of gravity shifts

### Intensity Guidelines
- Aim for **moderate intensity** (you should be able to hold a conversation)
- Use the **Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)** scale: stay between 5-7 out of 10
- **Heart rate monitoring** is less reliable during pregnancy, so focus on how you feel

### Frequency and Duration
- **150 minutes of moderate exercise per week** (as recommended by ACOG)
- **Break it into manageable sessions** (30 minutes, 5 days a week, or shorter daily sessions)
- **Include variety** with cardio, strength training, and flexibility work

## Best Cardio Exercises for Second Trimester

### Walking
**Why it's great:** Low impact, easily adjustable intensity, can be done anywhere
**Tips:**
- Wear supportive shoes with good cushioning
- Choose flat, even surfaces when possible
- Start with 10-15 minutes and gradually increase
- Use a pregnancy support belt if needed for comfort

### Swimming and Water Aerobics
