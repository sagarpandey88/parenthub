## Understanding the Fourth Trimester

The postpartum period, often called the "fourth trimester," encompasses the first 12 weeks after giving birth. This is a time of significant physical, emotional, and lifestyle changes as your body heals and you adjust to life with your new baby. Understanding what to expect and how to care for yourself during this crucial period can help you recover more comfortably and confidently.
