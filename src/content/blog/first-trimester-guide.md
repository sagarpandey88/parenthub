## Welcome to Your First Trimester

The first trimester spans from conception through week 12 of pregnancy and is a time of incredible change for both you and your developing baby. While you may not look pregnant yet, your body is working overtime to create and nurture new life. Understanding what to expect can help you navigate this exciting yet sometimes challenging period with confidence.

## What's Happening with Your Baby

### Weeks 1-4: The Beginning
- Conception occurs
- The fertilized egg implants in the uterine wall
- The placenta begins to form
- Basic organs start developing

### Weeks 5-8: Rapid Development
- The heart begins to beat (around week 6)
- Arms and legs start to form
- Facial features begin to develop
- The neural tube (future brain and spinal cord) forms

### Weeks 9-12: Taking Shape
- All major organs are present
- Baby is now called a fetus
- Fingers and toes become distinct
- Baby begins to move (though you won't feel it yet)

By the end of the first trimester, your baby is about 3 inches long and weighs approximately 1 ounce.
